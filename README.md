# Card War

A simple card game created in pygame, you pick a card and so does your opponent, whoever has the higher card wins both cards. The suit doesn't matter, and the card value from lowest to highest is: 0-11 < J < Q < K < A < Joker. The music and sound was created by me in LMMS, the card designs are from https://www.me.uk/cards/ (I added the words JOKER to the joker card).
